## 3. Core Process

**Super Admin Flow:**
The Super Admin initializes the system, configures basic settings, and creates the first Restaurant Admin account. They manage system-wide configurations, monitor overall performance, and handle user management at the highest level.

**Restaurant Admin Flow:**
Restaurant Admins log in to access the dashboard, review analytics, and manage gallery content. They upload new images, organize existing content, update restaurant information, and invite Content Managers. They also monitor API usage and manage content publication workflows.

**Content Manager Flow:**
Content Managers focus on day-to-day content operations. They upload images, add metadata, organize gallery albums, and update menu information. They work within permissions set by Restaurant Admins.

**API Consumer Flow:**
Frontend applications authenticate using API keys, request gallery data, retrieve restaurant information, and consume optimized images. The API provides filtered, cached responses for optimal performance.
